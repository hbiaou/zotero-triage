# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2025-01-22)

**Core value:** Users can progressively process their Zotero backlog without overwhelm, ensuring every imported literature note meets quality standards.

**Current focus:** Phase 2 - Batch Workflow

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 5 (Batch Workflow)
Plan: 02 of 04
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-01-23 — Completed 02-02-PLAN.md (Triage Dashboard UI)

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 30%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 6
- Average duration: 16 min
- Total execution time: 1.7 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation | 4/4 | 28 min | 7 min |
| 02-batch-workflow | 2/4 | 69 min | 35 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-03 (7 min), 01-04 (8 min), 02-01 (65 min), 02-02 (4 min)
- Trend: Phase 2 average higher due to 02-01 infrastructure work, but 02-02 fast execution

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: Direct SQLite access (via sql.js) for performance with large libraries (VALIDATED in 01-02)
- Phase 1: JSON registry over SQLite for simpler MVP state management (can migrate later if needed)
- Phase 1: Read-only database access to prevent writing to Zotero (safety constraint)
- Plan 01-02: Use sql.js wasmBinary option with fs.readFileSync for WASM loading
- Plan 01-02: Schema version range 100-200 to support Zotero 6.x and 7.x
- Plan 01-02: Chunk size of 50 items for UI responsiveness
- Plan 01-03: 2000ms debounce delay for registry saves (balance data safety vs I/O)
- Plan 01-03: Registry stored in plugin data.json alongside settings
- Plan 01-04: Always quote author names in YAML to handle special characters
- Plan 01-04: Use folded block scalar (>) for abstracts in YAML
- Plan 01-04: 100 character filename limit for cross-platform compatibility
- Plan 02-01: Default batch size 5 items (conservative, encourages small sessions)
- Plan 02-01: Most recent items first (sort by dateAdded descending)
- Plan 02-01: Deferred state distinct from rejected (allows re-including in batches)
- Plan 02-01: getAllEntries returns { id, entry } array for velocity calculations
- Plan 02-02: Undo timeout 3 seconds (per CONTEXT.md specification)
- Plan 02-02: Progress indicator with dual display (text + visual bar)
- Plan 02-02: Card abstract truncated at 200 characters for layout balance
- Plan 02-02: Button hierarchy: Accept (accent), Defer (neutral), Reject (text with border)
- Plan 02-02: Triage view in right sidebar for accessible workflow

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 1 (Foundation):** COMPLETE
- SQLite locking: MITIGATED - sql.js reads database into memory
- Schema changes: RESOLVED - Version detection implemented in 01-02
- UI freezing: RESOLVED - processInChunks implemented in 01-02

**Phase 2 (Batch Workflow):**
- Card-based UI patterns: RESOLVED - Implemented in 02-02 with theme-compatible CSS

**Phase 4 (Onboarding):**
- Recommendation algorithm: Need to design similarity scoring (tag matching, author overlap, citation signals)
